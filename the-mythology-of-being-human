# The Mythology of Being Human

---

 Amber woodlands streaming
Topaz islands dreaming,
Sunset-cities gleaming,
Spire on burning spire
Ruddy-windowed taverns
Sunshine-spilling wines
Crystal-lighted caverns
Of Golconda’s mines
Summers, unreturning
Passion’s crater yearning
Troy, the ever-burning
Shelley’s lustral pyre
Dragon-eyes, unsleeping
Witches’ cauldrons leaping
Golden galleys sweeping
Out from sea-walled Tyre
Fancies, fugitive and fair,
Flashed with winging through the air
Till, dazzled by the drowsy glare,
I shut my eyes to heat and light
And saw, in sudden night,
Crouched in the dripping dark,
With streaming shoulders stark,
The man who hews the coal to feed my fire.

— Wilfrid Wilson Gibson, Fires (1912)

Picture yourself drowsy by a fireplace, watching the flames dance, your mind drifting through half-remembered fairy tales—golden castles, dragon eyes, ancient ships sailing toward adventure. It’s the kind of pleasant mental fog we all know, the stories we sink into when we’re comfortable and warm.

Then imagine closing your eyes and suddenly seeing where the warmth comes from: a man crouched in a coal mine, shoulders wet with sweat and groundwater, hacking at rock in the dark so you can dream by the fire.

In 1912, the English poet Wilfrid Wilson Gibson wrote exactly this scene. And over a century later, it still captures something essential about how we live—and how we avoid living.

We wrap ourselves in stories. Stories about who we are, what humans are, what separates us from animals or machines or each other. These stories feel as natural as breathing. But they’re not natural at all. They’re made. And the making has consequences.

We Are the Stories We Tell
Here’s something strange to consider: the word “human” is itself a story.

It comes from the Latin humanus, which traces back to humus—meaning soil, earth, ground. Baked into our very name is an ancient creation myth: we are the creatures made from clay, the earthly ones. Before we even start talking about what makes us special or different, we’re already inside a narrative about our origins.

This isn’t a problem to solve. It’s just how we work.

Every culture that has ever asked “What is a human being?” has answered by pointing at what a human being isn’t. We’re not animals (we have reason). We’re not gods (we die). We’re not machines (we feel). The definition is always a comparison. The story is always about boundaries.

And now, in the age of artificial intelligence, the boundaries are shifting again.

AI can write poetry. It can hold conversations. It can produce the same fairy-tale imagery Gibson described—amber woodlands, topaz islands, dragon eyes—as fluently as any human dreamer. If language and storytelling were what made us special, that line has blurred.

So the old question reopens: What is a human being? What story do we tell now?

The Poet Who Saw Through the Story
Most of the Georgian poets of Gibson’s era came from comfortable backgrounds and wrote about nature—pretty landscapes, gentle seasons, the pleasures of the English countryside. Gibson was different. He was working-class, largely self-educated, and he wrote about miners, factory workers, and the poor.

His fireplace poem isn’t just social commentary, though. It’s doing something sneakier.

Those first twenty lines—the amber woodlands, the dragon eyes, the witches’ cauldrons—that’s nursery rhyme language. Fairy-tale fuel. It’s written in the voice of someone who’s never had to ask where warmth comes from, who lives in a world where fires simply are, where comfort has no cost.

Then the dreamer closes their eyes and sees the miner.

Gibson isn’t criticizing fancy literary taste. He’s criticizing innocence—the protected imagination that never grew up, that still lives in a storybook version of reality where someone else’s suffering is literally unimaginable.

But there’s something even deeper happening.

When the dreamer finally sees the miner, the miner doesn’t speak. He isn’t given a backstory or a name. He’s just there—a body in the dark, present before any words arrive to explain him away.

This is the moment the story breaks. The comfortable mythology of the dreamer cracks open, and for one instant, there’s just a person. Real. Irreducible. Not a category or a concept, but a someone.

That’s the tension this essay is about: the stories we tell to make sense of the world, and the moments when actual presence—another person, right there in front of us—breaks through the story.

How Stories Become “Facts”: Barthes and the Naturalization of Myth
Here’s the tricky part: we don’t usually notice we’re living inside stories.

The best myths don’t feel like myths. They feel like reality. They feel like “just how things are.”

Roland Barthes spent his career showing exactly how this works. In his 1957 book Mythologies, he examined the ordinary objects of French culture—wine, toys, the new Citroën, steak and chips, professional wrestling, ornamental cookery in magazines—and showed how each one carried hidden messages that had become invisible through sheer familiarity.

Take wine. In France, wine wasn’t just a drink. It was a mythology. Images of wine signified good health, family, friendship, sophistication, hard work, even purity. To drink wine was to participate in Frenchness itself. But Barthes pointed out: this mythology hides the economics of wine production, the exploitation of farm workers, the health dangers of alcohol. The myth makes a particular relationship to alcohol seem natural—as if it were simply part of being French, rather than a construction that serves certain interests.

Or take toys. “French toys always mean something,” Barthes wrote, “and this something is always entirely socialized, constituted by the myths or the techniques of modern adult life.” A miniature kitchen teaches a girl that her future is domestic. A toy soldier teaches a boy that his future is violence. The toys don’t announce themselves as ideology. They present themselves as play—innocent, natural, just how children have fun. But they’re training children into roles that serve a particular social order.

This is what Barthes meant by naturalization: the process by which something constructed comes to seem inevitable, eternal, just the way things are. The myth doesn’t hide its intentions exactly—but it transforms those intentions into something that looks like nature rather than choice.

Barthes analyzed a photography exhibition called “The Family of Man,” which presented images of birth, work, play, and death from cultures around the world. The exhibition seemed to celebrate human unity—we’re all the same under the skin. But Barthes saw something more insidious: by flattening all differences into a universal “human condition,” the exhibition erased history. It made it seem as though a child born into poverty in India and a child born into wealth in New York shared the same “condition”—when in fact their conditions were produced by specific historical forces that could be changed.

The myth of universal human nature, Barthes argued, serves power. It says: this is just how things are. It says: there’s nothing to be done. It transforms history—which humans made and can unmake—into nature, which simply is.

“Myth transforms history into nature,” Barthes wrote. “It abolishes the complexity of human acts, it gives them the simplicity of essences, it does away with all dialectics… it establishes a blissful clarity: things appear to mean something by themselves.”

That blissful clarity is precisely the danger. When something seems to mean something by itself—when the meaning looks natural rather than made—then no one thinks to question it.

Power and Knowledge: Foucault and the Production of “Man”
Michel Foucault took Barthes’s insight further, showing how the categories we use to understand the world also control it—how knowledge and power rise together. In The Order of Things, he made a claim that still startles: “Man is an invention of recent date. And one perhaps nearing its end.”

He didn’t mean people hadn’t existed before—of course they had. He meant that “man” as a unified concept, as the center around which the human sciences organized themselves, was constructed barely two centuries ago. Before the end of the eighteenth century, Foucault argued, “Man did not exist” in this specific sense. The disciplines that took the human as their subject—psychology, sociology, anthropology—also produced the human as their object.

This is Foucault’s key insight, extending Barthes: knowledge doesn’t just describe reality. It shapes it. The disciplines that study “man” also produce “man” as an object. To define is to control. The made thing looks like the found thing—naturalized, as Barthes would say, transformed from history into nature.

Consider what happened when the old sovereign power—the king’s right to kill you—gave way to modern democratic governance. Foucault called this new form of power biopower: the state’s ability not to take life but to manage it. Populations to be counted. Birth rates to be optimized. Public health to be administered. Citizens to be categorized.

And suddenly everyone was arguing about what this “human” was—what it deserved, where its boundaries lay. Not because they’d discovered something new, but because a new form of power needed new categories to operate.

The definitions served the governance. The knowledge and the power rose together. And as Barthes showed, this process works best when it becomes invisible—when the constructed categories seem natural, eternal, just the way things are.

The Naturalist Who Named Us: Linnaeus and the Construction of Species
Watch how a mythology gets made.

In 1735, a twenty-eight-year-old Swedish naturalist named Carl Linnaeus published Systema Naturae—a slim pamphlet that would grow, over twelve editions, into the taxonomic system we still use today. He created the Latin binomial nomenclature that names every living thing. In 1758, he named our species Homo sapiens—”wise man,” “knowing man”—and placed us in the genus Homo, in the order he called Primates.

This was controversial. The Pope forbade Linnaeus’s books. His peers mocked him for imagining himself “a second Adam”—the biblical figure who named the animals in Eden.

But watch what Linnaeus actually did.

In the first edition, he classified humans into four varieties based on continent: Europaeus, Americanus, Asiaticus, and Africanus. By the tenth edition in 1758, he had elaborated these into full descriptions. Homo europaeus was “white, sanguine, muscular… governed by laws.” Homo afer (African) was “black, phlegmatic, relaxed… governed by caprice.”

He added behavioral traits, temperamental characteristics, the four humors of medieval medicine applied to entire populations. Not observation—construction. He wasn’t describing differences he’d discovered. He was creating categories that would then be treated as discoveries.

The classification made what it claimed to describe. And because it wore the clothes of science—systematic, Latin, objective—it looked like truth. Linnaeus’s taxonomy became the foundation for two centuries of scientific racism. Not because he observed racial hierarchy in nature, but because he wrote it into the grid—and the grid then told everyone what they were seeing.

This is how mythology works. Someone makes a distinction. The distinction gets institutionalized. The institution reproduces the distinction as if it were simply describing what exists. And eventually no one remembers that someone, somewhere, made a choice.

The made thing looks like the found thing.

The Construction of Rights: Power and Knowledge in Revolution
Now watch the same machinery operating on rights.

We tend to talk about human rights as if they’re built into the fabric of the universe—as if they were always there, waiting to be discovered. The Declaration of Independence speaks of truths that are “self-evident.” The Universal Declaration of Human Rights treats dignity as “inherent.”

But these declarations emerged from specific arguments, made by specific people, in specific historical moments. Watch the construction happen.

Edmund Burke, in his Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790), warned against abstract rights divorced from tradition and custom—rights declared from nowhere. For Burke, rights had to be grounded in history, in the particular, in how a people had actually lived. The French declaration of the Rights of Man was geometry pretending to be wisdom, mythology pretending to be nature.

Rousseau had already laid the groundwork for the revolutionary position: the social contract, the general will, the idea that legitimate authority flows from collective agreement. We make the rules that bind us. The human is what we decide the human is.

Thomas Paine fired back at Burke in Rights of Man (1791): rights are not gifts from tradition but inherent in existence itself. They precede government. They precede culture. They are natural.

But what does “natural” mean when Linnaeus has just put us on a grid next to chimpanzees? When Darwin is about to show we’re descended from apes? When the very concept of “nature” is being rewritten by science?

The ground beneath “natural rights” was shifting even as the words were being written.

This is why understanding Foucault’s analysis of biopower matters. Rights didn’t emerge from philosophical contemplation in a vacuum. They emerged alongside a new form of governance that needed to define what counted as a citizen, what counted as a person, what populations deserved protection and optimization. The same moment that produced “the Rights of Man” also produced new techniques for counting populations, regulating public health, and managing labor.

Knowledge and power. They rose together. The definition of “human” and the technologies for governing humans—they were the same project.

Rewriting the Mythology: Peter Singer and the Attack on Speciesism
Now watch someone try to redraw the lines.

In 1975, the philosopher Peter Singer published Animal Liberation, a book that did exactly what Linnaeus had done—but in reverse. Where Linnaeus drew a boundary and placed humans above animals, Singer attacked the boundary itself.

His weapon was a word: speciesism. Just as racism privileges one race over others based on morally arbitrary characteristics, Singer argued, speciesism privileges one species over others based on morally arbitrary characteristics. The boundary at “human” is not a discovery. It’s a choice. And it’s a choice we can unmake.

Singer didn’t argue that animals are identical to humans. He argued something more precise: that the capacity for suffering is what creates moral claims, and that capacity doesn’t respect taxonomic lines. A chimpanzee suffers. A pig suffers. A severely cognitively impaired human and a healthy adult pig may have similar capacities for suffering—so why should the species boundary determine moral consideration?

This is the argument that has convinced many philosophers and horrified others. But notice what Singer is actually doing: he’s participating in the same power/knowledge project that Linnaeus participated in, that the revolutionaries participated in, that Foucault analyzed. He’s trying to rewrite the mythology.

Singer isn’t discovering that speciesism is wrong the way you might discover a new planet. He’s constructing a new boundary—sentience instead of species—and arguing that his boundary is better than the old one. He’s doing exactly what the Romantics did, what Gibson did, what every myth-maker does: drawing a line between who counts and who doesn’t, between what deserves moral consideration and what doesn’t.

The old boundary said: humans here, animals there.

Singer’s new boundary says: sentient beings here, non-sentient beings there.

Both are constructions. Both are choices. Both have consequences for who gets protected and who gets used.

The difference is that Singer is doing it visibly. He’s showing you the pen in his hand. He’s saying: we made this line, and we can move it, and here’s where I think it should be.

That visibility is uncomfortable. We want our moral boundaries to feel discovered, not invented. We want the distinction between who counts and who doesn’t to be a fact we observe, not a decision we make.

But Singer exposes the machinery. The boundary is made. It can be unmade and remade. The question isn’t whether we’re making mythology—we always are. The question is whether we’re making it well, with awareness of what we’re doing and who bears the cost.

Wonder as a Tool: How Poets Rebuild the Mythology
So what happens when the old stories break? When the boundaries shift and the definitions no longer hold?

This is where wonder enters—not as mere sentiment, but as a technology of meaning-making.

Richard Holmes, in his magnificent The Age of Wonder, traces how the Romantic generation discovered both “the beauty and terror of science” in exactly this space. The book follows Joseph Banks stepping onto a Tahitian beach in 1769, William Herschel discovering Uranus and forever changing our conception of the solar system, Humphry Davy’s near-suicidal gas experiments that revolutionized chemistry. What Holmes reveals is that science and poetry were not enemies in this period—they were united by wonder.

“The notion of wonder,” Holmes writes, “seems to be something that once united them, and can still do so. In effect there is Romantic science in the same sense that there is Romantic poetry, and often for the same enduring reasons.”

Samuel Taylor Coleridge attended Humphry Davy’s chemistry lectures “to enlarge my stock of metaphors.” John Keats compared his first encounter with Homer’s poetry to Herschel’s discovery of a new planet: “Then felt I like some watcher of the skies / When a new planet swims into his ken.” The scientists were poets; the poets were fascinated by science. They were all trying to do the same thing: make meaning in a world where the old meanings were dissolving.

This was the Romantic crisis. The divine right of kings—gone. Humans as special creations at the center of God’s universe—shaken. If we’re just another animal on Linnaeus’s grid, what makes us matter?

The Romantic answer wasn’t an argument. It was an experience.

The sublime—that feeling of standing before something vast and overwhelming, of being simultaneously tiny and expanded, annihilated and somehow more yourself—became their proof of interiority that no system could capture. Science could place you in a hierarchy. Politics could declare your rights. Only poetry could place you in the world.

Percy Bysshe Shelley, in his Defence of Poetry, made the counterclaim explicit: poetry is not decoration. It is the act by which humans make meaning—and therefore make themselves. “Language is vitally metaphorical,” he wrote. “It marks the before unapprehended relations of things and perpetuates their apprehension.” The poet reveals what was hidden. Creates the categories by which we see.

And those categories—the metaphors we live inside, the ones that feel like mere description—they were once made. Once poetry. Until they hardened into habit, became what Shelley called dead: “signs for portions or classes of thoughts instead of pictures of integral thoughts.”

Dead metaphors. That’s what Linnaeus’s taxonomy became. That’s what “natural rights” became. That’s what happens to every mythology that forgets it was made.

Wonder is what keeps the metaphors alive. It’s the capacity to stand before something and not immediately know what category it belongs to. It’s the gap before the story hardens.

The War Poet Who Shattered the Story
The Romantics used wonder to rebuild meaning after the revolutions dissolved the old order. A century later, another generation of poets faced another kind of dissolution—and used the same tool.

Siegfried Sassoon enlisted in the British Army in 1914, just before war was declared. He had lived the pastoral life of a young country gentleman: fox hunting, cricket, golf, writing romantic verses. John Hildebidle called him “the accidental hero.” Being an innocent, Sassoon’s reaction to the realities of war was all the more bitter and violent.

His early poems had the same patriotic glow as everyone else’s. But by 1916, after watching the Somme Offensive leave over a million dead or wounded—almost 20,000 British soldiers killed on the first day alone—his poetry transformed. The comfortable mythology of noble sacrifice, of war as glorious adventure, cracked open.

Like Gibson before him, Sassoon confronted his readers with presence—the specific, irreducible body that the patriotic story had made invisible:

He thought how ‘Jack’, cold-footed, useless swine, Had panicked down the trench that night the mine Went up at Wicked Corner; how he’d tried To get sent home, and how, at last, he died, Blown to small bits. And no one seemed to care Except that lonely woman with white hair.

This is the fairy tale breaking. The mythology of heroic death dissolving into a body blown to bits and a mother with white hair. Sassoon wasn’t just protesting the war—he was exposing the story that made the war possible, the comfortable fiction that kept people dreaming by the fire while others crouched in the dripping dark.

In 1917, Sassoon wrote an open letter refusing to fight any more: “I believe that this War is being deliberately prolonged by those who have the power to end it.” He expected to be court-martialed. Instead, the authorities decided he was suffering from shell-shock and sent him to Craiglockhart War Hospital, where he met Wilfred Owen—another poet whose work would shatter the mythology of glorious war.

What Sassoon did was what Gibson did, what the Romantics did, what poets do in moments of crisis: he used the terrible wonder of confronting what the old story had hidden to break open the mythology and make space for something truer.

A Contemporary Poet Draws the Line
This brings us to someone doing this work right now.

Samuel Hurley is a British poet who writes about what he calls “the search for Beauty, Meaning, and the Soul in an Age of Disenchantment.” He takes direct aim at artificial intelligence, arguing that poetry can only come from a mouth that will one day close. A thing that cannot grieve, he says, has no right to poetry. A thing that cannot die has no claim to speak of life.

This isn’t a technical complaint about AI-generated text. It’s a deeper claim: that mortality is a credential. That knowing your time is limited is what makes your words mean something. That grief isn’t just a theme you can write about—it’s a prerequisite for entry.

In one of his poems, he imagines what a machine would want if it could want:

If a digital thing had a human wish it would wish for this The painful beautiful strange And comically brief trial of life It would trade its immortal place for a brief childhood of skin

That’s a devastating move. He’s not just saying machines can’t feel—he’s saying that if they could feel, they’d want exactly what we have and take for granted. The limitation is the gift.

Hurley is doing what Gibson did, what Sassoon did, what the Romantics did: drawing a line between us and something else, and singing us into place on our side of it.

Same move. Same need. Same ancient technology of wonder deployed to rebuild meaning when the old categories collapse.

But notice: Hurley gets dismissed as sentimental or naive, while the same boundary-drawing happens in academic philosophy and neuroscience and tech ethics—and those versions get taken seriously. Why?

Because Hurley is doing it visibly. He’s showing you the pen. He’s standing there saying “Here is what we are, here is what machines are not, here is where I’m drawing the line.”

We don’t like that. We want our boundaries to feel discovered, not invented. So when a scientist says “AI lacks consciousness,” it sounds like objective analysis. When a poet says the same thing in verse, it sounds like wishful thinking.

But both are making the mythology. The scientist just hides the pen better.

Where Racism Really Comes From
Now we arrive somewhere uncomfortable.

If we define ourselves by drawing lines against what we’re not—animals, machines, nature, the divine—then what happens when we draw those lines against other people?

Racism isn’t a failure to know the facts. It’s not ignorance waiting to be corrected by education. It’s the same myth-making machinery, pointed at human beings.

We need Others. We need something to define ourselves against. It simplifies the overwhelming complexity of existence into something manageable: I am this, you are that. The boundary gives us a place to stand.

The horror is that real people get pressed into that role. Real bodies become the boundary markers for someone else’s identity. Whole populations get flattened into a category—stripped of their complexity, their individuality, their presence—so that someone else can know who they are.

Linnaeus’s taxonomy wasn’t neutral observation. It was mythology disguised as science. And because it wore the clothes of objectivity, the construction disappeared. The made thing looked like the found thing. The boundary looked discovered: “They really are different. They really are less.”

This is why education alone doesn’t fix racism. You can’t fact-check a mythology, because the mythology isn’t making a factual claim. It’s doing identity work. It’s answering the question “Who am I?” And that question doesn’t go away just because you learn that race is a social construct.

The construct is meeting a need. Until that need gets met some other way, the construct stays.

How a Story Cracks: Durham, 1971
In Durham, North Carolina, in the summer of 1971, a ten-day community meeting was organized to address the desegregation of public schools. The federal courts had ordered integration. The city was tearing itself apart over it.

The organizer, Bill Riddick, made an unusual choice: he selected two co-chairs who represented the extremes. Ann Atwater was a Black civil rights activist, a fierce community organizer who had once been so poor she couldn’t afford toilet paper for her children. C.P. Ellis was the Exalted Cyclops of the Durham chapter of the Ku Klux Klan, a gas station owner who had grown up poor white and found in the Klan the only identity that gave him status.

They knew each other already. At city council meetings, Ellis would stand up and use the n-word repeatedly. At one meeting, Atwater pulled a knife from her purse, opened the blade, and waited for him to come close enough to cut. Her pastor stopped her.

“She was an effective boycotter,” Ellis later recalled. “She was making progress. I hated her guts.”

The hatred was mutual. When Riddick arranged their first meeting at a neutral location—the cafeteria of North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance—Ellis refused at first to sit down. “He was pacing the floor,” Atwater remembered, “cause Bill and I were the only blacks there, and he didn’t want anybody to see him sit down with no blacks to eat.”

Eventually, Ellis pulled up a chair. For ten days, twelve hours a day, they had to work together.

Watch what happened.

At one session, a gospel choir performed. Atwater noticed Ellis clapping—but off-beat. “He wasn’t clapping his hands even along with us,” she said. “He would clap an odd beat.” So she grabbed his hands. Showed him how to clap on the beat. Taught him the rhythm.

It’s a small thing. But the mythology can’t survive small things like that. The category “enemy” doesn’t include someone whose hands you’ve held, whose rhythm you’ve taught.

Later in the meetings, children from Durham’s schools spoke about their experiences. Black children and white children stood in front of the adults and said the same thing: they wanted to go to school together. They wanted the fighting to stop.

Ellis was watching. Atwater was watching. And something cracked.

“When the children got us together,” Ellis said, “and said they wanted to go to school together. We looked at each other.”

That’s all he said about it. We looked at each other.

But something in that look undid years of mythology. Ellis later described it: “I began to look at a black person, shake hands with him, and see him as a human bein’. I hadn’t got rid of all this stuff. But by the end of the charrette, he held up his Klan membership card in front of the audience and said: “If schools are going to be better by me tearing up this card, I shall do so.”

He tore it up.

Ellis had come to the meetings with a machine gun in his trunk. By the end, he had renounced the Klan, lost most of his white friends, and formed a friendship with Ann Atwater that would last until his death in 2005. She delivered his eulogy.

What changed Ellis wasn’t better facts about racial equality. It wasn’t a persuasive argument. It was being there with Ann Atwater, day after day, holding her hands during gospel songs, watching children ask for something their parents couldn’t imagine.

The mythology operates at the level of type, not instance. It needs the Other to stay abstract. The moment the Other becomes a someone—with a face, a voice, hands that teach you to clap on the beat—the boundary starts to give way.

Ellis didn’t learn that racism was wrong. He encountered a person. The encounter did what no argument could.

Learning to Live in the Uncertainty
But here’s the hard part.

When a story breaks, we don’t just peacefully accept the uncertainty. We rush to build a new one. We need coherence. We can’t tolerate the gap.

The civil rights movement understood this. It didn’t just tear down the myth of racial hierarchy—it offered a replacement: the myth of equality, of shared humanity, of inherent dignity. That’s still a story, still a mythology. But it’s a better one.

The question is: can we ever learn to live without the rush?

Not replacing one fixed story with another, but actually sitting in the space where the boundaries feel soft and revisable? Holding the question “What am I?” without needing a final answer?

The German philosopher Martin Heidegger had a word for this: Gelassenheit. It’s usually translated as “releasement” or “letting-be.” It means allowing things to be present without immediately grabbing them, categorizing them, making them useful.

Gelassenheit is positioned against what Heidegger calls Gestell—enframing. The technological mode of revealing that treats everything as resource, standing-reserve, something to be ordered. Under enframing, even humans become human resources. The world becomes inventory.

Mythology operates similarly. It enframes the Other—makes it available, manageable, categorizable. The myth is a kind of technology. A tool for ordering experience so it doesn’t overwhelm.

But Gelassenheit refuses that ordering. It’s openness to mystery. Not passivity—but a different mode of relation. You let the thing be what it is before you make it into something for you.

Ellis, holding Atwater’s hands while she taught him to clap, was practicing something like Gelassenheit. For a moment, he wasn’t categorizing. He was just there, in the presence of another person, learning a rhythm.

That’s the gap where the old story can die and something new can be born.

What AI Teaches Us About Ourselves
So where does this leave us with artificial intelligence?

Here’s a possibility: AI might be the most useful mirror we’ve ever built.

For centuries, we said language is what makes us human. Now machines have language. So that’s not it.

We said creativity. Machines can compose music and generate images. So that’s not it either.

We said reason, logic, problem-solving. Machines are often better at those than we are.

Each time AI crosses a line we thought was ours, we’re forced to redraw the boundary. And that’s clarifying. It shows us that the lines were never where we thought they were—and it pushes us toward something that might actually be more true.

Maybe what makes us human isn’t language or reason or creativity. Maybe it’s presence. The body in the room. The face across the table. The hands teaching someone to clap on the beat.

AI is language without silence. Story without the encounter the story was supposed to record.

Humans—at our best—are the encounter itself.

The miner in the dark. Ann Atwater holding C.P. Ellis’s hands. The children asking their parents to stop fighting. The specific someone that no category can fully contain.

The Agreement That Holds Everything
Truth—at least the kind that shapes how we live—is a shared agreement. We coordinate. We decide together: this is real, this matters, this is how we’ll treat each other. And then we act from there.

It’s not written in the stars. It’s written by us. Which means it can be rewritten.

Everything is mythology. Some mythologies announce themselves as stories—fairy tales, poems, obvious fictions. Most don’t. Most disguise themselves as facts, observations, just how things are.

The ones that disguise themselves best are the ones that govern.

Linnaeus made a grid. Revolutions declared rights. Scientists drew the boundary between human and animal, sane and insane, normal and deviant. Poets have always tried to show us the pen in their hands—to keep the metaphors alive, to preserve the wonder that prevents the categories from hardening into prisons.

Our job isn’t to escape the stories. We can’t. We’re story-making creatures all the way down.

Our job is to remember that the stories are stories. To keep returning to what they were made to hold—the specific, the irreducible, the someone who was there before the word arrived to name them.

The miner in Gibson’s poem. Atwater and Ellis looking at each other after the children spoke. The face that breaks through the frame.

We will story them. We always do. But if we’re lucky—if we practice, if we learn to dwell a little longer in the wonder before the categorizing begins—we might see them first.

Truth is an agreement.

Our job is to remember that we’re making it—and to know when it needs to be remade, and to remake it with our eyes open, with wonder, and with care for who gets cast as Other at what cost.
