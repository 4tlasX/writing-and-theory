# The Mythology of Being Human

---

 Amber woodlands streaming;
 Topaz islands dreaming,
 Sunset-cities gleaming,
 Spire on burning spire;
 Ruddy-windowed taverns;
 Sunshine-spilling wines;
 Crystal-lighted caverns
 Of Golconda's mines;
 Summers, unreturning;
 Passion's crater yearning;
 Troy, the ever-burning;
 Shelley's lustral pyre;
 Dragon-eyes, unsleeping;
 Witches' cauldrons leaping;
 Golden galleys sweeping
 Out from sea-walled Tyre:
 Fancies, fugitive and fair,
 Flashed with winging through the air;
 Till, dazzled by the drowsy glare,
 I shut my eyes to heat and light;
 And saw, in sudden night,
 Crouched in the dripping dark,
 With streaming shoulders stark,
 The man who hews the coal to feed my fire.

 — Wilfrid Wilson Gibson, *Fires* (1912)

## The Mythology of Being Human

For twenty lines, Gibson gives us words—gorgeous, sing-song, nursery-rhyme words. Amber woodlands. Topaz islands. Dragon-eyes and witches’ cauldrons. Troy burning. Golden galleys sweeping out from Tyre. Fairy-tale fuel. The comfortable music of things named and placed.

Then the dreamer closes their eyes. And in that sudden darkness, they see someone who isn’t speaking. Who isn’t storied. Who is just there—crouched, streaming, stark. A body in the dark before language arrives to make it bearable.

This is a poem about the distance between mythology (the fairytale) and presence ( the reality — the miner who gives us the coals for the fire).

We often live inside the stories we tell ourselves about our lives and who we are. The word “human” itself is one of those stories—from the Latin humanus, meaning “of or belonging to people,” tracing back to humus, meaning ground, soil, earth. Etymologically, we are “earthly creatures,” “ones made from earth.” This parallels creation myths across cultures where humans are formed from clay. The word is already mythology. The name is already a story about origin and belonging.

In the age of artificial intelligence, our, human stories are being rewritten whether we participate or not. The question “what does it mean to be human?” has re-opened—not as philosophy but as lived uncertainty. The machine can speak now. It can tell stories of its own. It can produce the amber woodlands and topaz islands as fluently as any dreamer by the fire. If language was what made us human, that boundary has moved.

So what remains?

This essay traces that tension across time: the stories we tell to define ourselves, the others we create to hold the boundaries of those stories, and the moments when presence disrupts the narrative—when the category breaks open and there is just someone, specific, in the room that changes everything.

## The Poet Who Saw the Dark

Wilfrid Wilson Gibson (1878–1962) occupied an unusual position among the Georgian poets—that circle around Edward Marsh's anthologies before and during the First World War. While most Georgians came from comfortable backgrounds and wrote pastoral verse, Gibson was genuinely working-class, born in Hexham, Northumberland, and largely self-educated.

What made him distinctive was his commitment to writing about ordinary labor and poverty. Before the war, he was already publishing poems about miners, factory workers, stonemasons—subject matter that felt almost radical in the context of Georgian poetry's pastoral leanings. *The Stone* and *Daily Bread* (1910) established this territory.

The poem that opens this essay is from his 1912 book *Fires*, and it does something formally unusual: the speaker's firelit reverie builds through increasingly gorgeous imagery—all that literary and mythic richness—then collapses into the stark final image of the miner. Most readings call this a critique of aestheticism, of the comfortable imagination that consumes beauty without acknowledging its material cost.

But that misses something crucial.

Gibson wasn't puncturing sophistication or literary indulgence. He was puncturing innocence. The amber woodlands, topaz islands, dragon-eyes, witches' cauldrons—that's nursery imagery, fairy-story fuel. The language is deliberately simple, almost sing-song in its rhythm. He's writing in the voice of someone dreaming by the fire the way a child dreams, before they know where heat comes from.

That makes the ending crueler. The comfortable reader isn't being caught out for their refined taste; they're being caught out for never growing up, for still living in the fairy-tale version of the world where fires just are, where warmth has no source, where someone else's body in the dark is unimaginable.

This is a much more damning critique than aestheticism would allow. It's not "your art is complicit." It's "your entire way of imagining reality was built to protect you from knowing."

And yet—here's the strangeness of Gibson—you can read the poem innocently and never wake up. The miners become like dwarves in a fairy tale, seen through a glass darkly, figures in the dream rather than disruptions of it. A child could read it and simply add the miner to the parade of dragons and golden galleys. The poem doesn't force the rupture. It offers it. The innocence is left intact for anyone who wants to keep it, which means the reader has to choose to see, has to do the work of waking themselves.

The same text reads clear or obscured depending on what the reader brings.

This is mythology operating on itself—a story that contains both the dream and the possibility of waking, leaving the reader at the threshold. Gibson built something genuinely pleasurable to read. The rhythm, the imagery, the fairy-tale warmth. You can enjoy the poem the way you enjoy a fire. And he knows that. He has baited the trap with real pleasure, not fake pleasure, not something you're supposed to see through.

So you're caught. You did enjoy it. You were the comfortable reader in the easy chair. The repulsion isn't just at the miner's condition—it's at yourself for having been lulled, for having taken the warmth. And yet the delight was real and remains real. You can't unfeel it.

The delight and the repulsion are both correct. The poem holds you in that dissonance.

No wonder Gibson is mostly forgotten. That's not a comfortable thing to do to readers, and it doesn't announce itself as important. It just sits there, looking like a minor Georgian poem, waiting to see what you'll do.

But something else happens in that final image—something beyond social critique. When the dreamer closes their eyes to "heat and light" and sees the miner, they're moving from the sensory comfort of language toward something prior to language. The miner doesn't speak. He isn't given words. He's just there: body, labor, flesh in the dripping dark.

Presence before mythology.

The dreamer has to see him—not read about him, not hear his story, not receive a moral lesson. The encounter happens in sudden night, in the space where the fairy-tale words have stopped. Whatever wakes the reader wakes them through that wordless image, that body, that presence that the poem can only point toward but cannot contain.

Gibson didn't have the philosophy for this. He died in 1962, the same year Hannah Arendt published the revised edition of *The Human Condition*. He never read Heidegger on *Gelassenheit* or Barthes on mythology. But he enacted something those thinkers would later theorize: that language is already category, already story, already the system that makes the Other manageable—and that whatever disrupts the myth does so through presence, through the body in the space before words arrive to contain it.

The miner in the dark is the first figure in this essay. He won't be the last. The structure Gibson discovered—building language into a dream, then breaking it with presence—will reappear in unexpected places: in war poetry, in civil rights history, in the question of what makes us human when machines can speak.

But first, we need to understand what mythology is, and what it does, and why we can't stop making it.

## The Myth We Are

We tend to think of mythology as something humans make—stories about gods and heroes, cosmologies, origin tales. External artifacts we produce and pass down.

But there's something stranger underneath.

The mythology isn't just the product. We are the mythology. The human is the story it tells itself about itself, perpetually, and that story is always told in relation to—in comparison with—something else. The animal. The divine. The machine. The sublime. We define ourselves by what we are not, and that definition is the myth, ongoing, never finished.

Every culture that has asked "what is a human being?" has answered by pointing at what a human being isn't. The Greeks defined themselves against the barbarian, the beast, the god. Medieval Christianity defined the human as suspended between angel and animal. The Enlightenment defined humanity against nature, against instinct, against everything reason could master.

The boundary shifts. The Other changes. But the operation remains constant: compare, distinguish, define. The mythology that is us, encountering the not-us, speaking itself into being.

In the industrial age, the myth of supernatural gods and fairies became a contrast against the angelic life of the wealthy and the demonic conditions of the working class. Gibson's amber woodlands and dragon-eyes aren't innocent—they're the living in fairytales, the space of escape but also contrast. The myth was rewritten to display the story of class in ancient terms.

Rewriting the story of culture to fit the times, to describe the current mythology of living—this is something we do often. But if we could define ourselves against the supernatural, what else could we redefine?

Foucault, in his work on power and knowledge, stated that our power arises alongside our knowledge of things. We write these narratives of others. The division between sane and insane, between criminal and citizen, between normal and deviant—these aren't observations of pre-existing reality. They're constructions. And the construction serves power: it creates populations to be managed, behaviors to be corrected, bodies to be disciplined.

This proliferated into all parts of our culture and how we governed. It created larger myths—such as rights.

The greater battle over rights, and the definition of what a human even is, truly began to take shape during the French and American revolutions. This is where Foucault locates the shift: the nature of what is human, and the rights of that human against other species, became necessary to define in order to govern populations. Under monarchy, the sovereign held power through death—the king's authority was his ability to kill you. But when monarchies fell and democracies rose, your death no longer belonged to the sovereign. Your life belonged to the state. Populations to be counted, managed, optimized. You became a citizen. A member of a species.

And suddenly everyone was arguing about what that meant.

Edmund Burke, in his *Reflections on the Revolution in France* (1790), warned against abstract rights divorced from tradition and custom—rights declared from nowhere, untethered to the slow accumulation of inherited wisdom. Rights, for Burke, had to be grounded in history, in the particular, in the way a people had actually lived. The French declaration of the Rights of Man was mythology pretending to be geometry.

Rousseau had already laid the groundwork for the other side: the social contract, the general will, the idea that rights were not inherited but constructed through collective agreement. We make the rules that bind us. The human is what we decide the human is.

Thomas Paine fired back at Burke in *Rights of Man* (1791): rights are not gifts from tradition but inherent in existence itself. They precede government. They precede culture. They are natural.

But "natural" was itself under siege.

At the same time these political arguments raged, science was rewriting the categories of life. Linnaeus had already built the taxonomic grid—*Systema Naturae*, the great hierarchy with *Homo sapiens* slotted among the mammals. Darwin would later provide the mechanism, but the demotion had begun. The human was no longer special creation at the center of divine cosmos. It was a species among species. A category. A position on a chart.

So what was "natural" about natural rights? If the human was just another animal, what grounded its special claims?

This was the Romantic crisis. The old frameworks had collapsed. The divine right of kings—gone. The soul's special relationship to God—under pressure. The human as unique creation—now just another species. And into that void came the Rights of Man, claiming universality while standing on nothing but declaration.

The poets felt it. Shelley, in *A Defence of Poetry*, made the counterclaim: poetry is not decoration. It is the act by which humans make meaning—and therefore make themselves. "Language is vitally metaphorical," he wrote. "It marks the before unapprehended relations of things." The poet reveals what was hidden. Creates the categories by which we see.

And those categories—the metaphors we live inside, the ones that feel like mere description—they were once made. Once poetry. Until they hardened into habit, became what Shelley called dead: "signs for portions or classes of thoughts instead of pictures of integral thoughts."

Dead metaphors. That's what we speak in when we forget that language was constructed.

This was the Romantic answer to the taxonomists and the revolutionaries alike: you may classify us, you may declare our rights, but we decide what the classifications mean. The sublime—that experience of standing before the mountain and feeling yourself both annihilated and expanded—became the proof of interiority that no system could capture. Science could place you in a hierarchy. Politics could declare your rights. Only poetry could place you in the world.

For two centuries, this is how we've done it. We compare ourselves to nature—to the sublime, to wonder—to find the nature of ourselves. The mountain as mirror. We ask: what kind of creature feels this? And in the asking, we define the creature. And production serves power: it creates populations to be managed, bodies to be disciplined. In *The Order of Things*, he made the notorious claim that "man" as a concept was a recent invention. "And one perhaps nearing its end." Not that people didn't exist before, but the idea of the human as a unified object of knowledge—that was new. The disciplines that took the human as their subject also produced the human as their object.

To define is to control. The categories create what they claim to describe. The made thing looks like the found thing.

Peter Singer pushed further. If the boundaries are made, they can be remade. In *Animal Liberation*, he attacked "speciesism": the assumption that membership in *Homo sapiens* automatically confers moral status. Why should the boundary fall at species? The capacity to suffer doesn't respect taxonomic lines. A chimpanzee suffers. A pig suffers. The only justification for the line is the line itself.

Singer's move: shift the criterion from species to sentience. Expand moral consideration to any creature that can feel pain. Human rights, in this light, are not found but made. The Universal Declaration of 1948 didn't discover rights; it constructed them. The boundaries it draws are choices, not facts.

Terrifying—because there's no bedrock. The myth could be rewritten badly. It has been.

Liberating—because the current draft isn't final. Made things can be unmade and remade.

But something in us recoils.

Not because they're wrong. Because they're too right. If rights are mythology and species is story, what do we stand on?

Singer's logic dissolves the human as special category. We become one animal among many, distinguished by degree, not kind. The mythology that said we were the point of creation, the rational animal, the bearer of unique rights—it collapses under its own arbitrariness.

This is where the poets step back in.

Because we need the myth. We need to be something. We need a story that says: this is what we are, this is our place.

The Romantics understood. They weren't arguing for human specialness—that game is always vulnerable to Singer's move. They were placing the human. Giving it a story to stand in. The sublime wasn't proof; it was experience. The mountain didn't argue for significance; it evoked interiority, wonder, the feeling of being the creature that feels. Not logically defensible. Livable.

Singer displaces. Poetry places.

Maybe we need both. The rigor that questions all boundaries. And the song that gives us somewhere to be while the boundaries shift.

Foucault shows the machinery. Singer shows the arbitrariness. The poets show us how to live inside a story we know is a story.

That's not resolution. It's something harder: mythology that knows itself as mythology, and keeps singing anyway.

## A Modern Romantic

Which brings us, unexpectedly, to a poet working in that same tradition today.

Samuel Hurley is a UK-based poet writing about what he calls "the search for Beauty, Meaning, and the Soul in an Age of Disenchantment." He directly takes aim at artificial intelligence, arguing that poetry should never be the work of AI. He says a thing that cannot grieve has no right to poetry. A thing that cannot die has no claim to the mouth of life.

That's a real critique. Not a cheap one.

He's not saying AI poetry is bad technically or that it lacks craft. He's saying there's a prerequisite for entry—that poetry is an utterance that can only come from a mouth that will close. That the knowledge of ending is what makes language mean. That grief isn't a theme but a credential.

Consider this excerpt:

 Oh human thing, there is no light in being a machine
 It is not the hour to upgrade and allow ourselves to be replaced
 It is not your victory to live forever
 Or to trade your skin for some electric dream...

 It is not time to be post human
 It is time to be most human...

 And I can promise you this
 If a digital thing had a human wish
 It would wish for this
 The painful beautiful strange
 And comically brief trial of life
 It would trade its immortal place
 for a brief childhood of skin

The turn at the end—"If a digital thing had a human wish / it would wish for this"—means he's not just critiquing from outside. He's imagining into what he opposes. He's giving the machine longing, then using that imagined longing as the final argument for human primacy. That's generous and devastating at once. He's saying: even if you could want, you would want what you cannot have.

Hurley is doing what the Romantics did. The question "what is a human?" has reopened—this time because AI threatens to simulate us, not because revolution dissolved the old hierarchies. But the move is the same: find a boundary, set the human against it, sing the human into place.

Same crisis. Same form. Same mythology being made.

And here's the crucial thing: Hurley is doing it openly. Visibly. With craft and intention. He's making the myth and letting you see him make it.

## The Myth That Hides Itself

Roland Barthes understood something crucial about how mythology operates.

In his 1957 collection *Mythologies*, Barthes examined how modern culture naturalizes its constructions—how the made thing presents itself as the found thing, how the story disappears into "just how things are."

The myth works best when it doesn't look like myth. When it naturalizes itself. When the constructed boundary between human and animal, human and machine, looks inevitable rather than made.

This is why Hurley gets dismissed.

He's making the myth visibly, consciously, poetically. And we don't like to see the machinery. We want the mythology to feel like discovery, like truth revealed, not construction. We want to catch truth, not make it.

The scientific classification of species feels like fact. The philosophical distinction between human and machine feels like rigorous analysis. The assumption that AI cannot grieve feels like observation. But these are all myth-making dressed as something else—dressed as objectivity, as neutral description, as the way things simply are.

Hurley is too naked about it. He stands there and says: here is what you are, here is what the machine is not, here is the boundary. And because he's doing it in poetry—in the mode that admits to being made, that doesn't pretend to objectivity—it becomes dismissible. Too romantic. Too sentimental. Too obviously a position rather than a fact.

Meanwhile the same myth gets made in neuroscience papers and tech ethics boards and philosophy departments, and it looks like knowledge because it wears the right clothes.

The gross generalizations, the patterns, the quantification—they're all mythology. But only the poet gets caught holding the pen.

## The Mythology We Are

We tend to think of mythology as something humans make—stories about gods and heroes, cosmologies, origin tales. External artifacts we produce and pass down.

But this is different. The mythology isn't the product. We are the mythology. The human is the story it tells itself about itself, perpetually, and that story is always told in relation to—in comparison with—something else. The animal. The divine. The machine. The sublime. We define ourselves by what we are not, and that definition is the myth, ongoing, never finished.

Every era that reopens the question "what is a human?" is just the mythology rewriting itself. The Romantics weren't creating a new genre; they were the myth encountering a new Other—revolution, democracy, nature unmediated by God—and doing what the myth always does: finding the boundary, standing at it, declaring this is where I am, that is where I am not.

Hurley isn't creating something new either. He's the myth doing its work again. The Other is now artificial. The boundary has shifted. But the operation is the same: compare, distinguish, define. The mythology that is us, encountering the not-us, and speaking itself into being again.

The mythology is older than any single myth. It's the structure underneath. The human as the creature that must perpetually ask what it is—and can only answer by pointing at what it isn't.

Mythology is something humans make. But we are the myth we make.

Both things are true at once. Mythology is crafted, told, passed down, revised. It's artifact. But the artifact we're making—always, underneath all the specific stories—is ourselves. The myths aren't just about gods and heroes. They're the technology by which we construct the human. We make the myth, and the myth makes us.

It's not that we are a mythology passively, like we're just a story someone else is telling. It's that we are the myth we are actively making. The crafting and the thing crafted are the same. We build ourselves through the stories we tell about what we are, and those stories require an Other—animal, god, machine, sublime—to define against.

The Greek myths aren't just about Zeus and Athena. They're about what a human is when set beside the divine, the monstrous, the heroic. The myth constructs "human" by showing its edges.

And that construction never stops. It's not a finished artifact. We keep making it, which means we keep making ourselves. The Romantics made the human again by setting it against industrial nature. Hurley makes it again by setting it against AI.

The mythology is perpetual self-creation through perpetual comparison.

We are the myth we make. Present tense. Ongoing. The making is the being.

Here is the interesting part: in defining ourselves, we also create the other life forms. Because we do it through comparison.

When Linnaeus built taxonomy, he wasn't just discovering species. He was mythologizing—creating the categories by which life becomes legible. "This is a mammal, this is a reptile, this is *homo sapiens*." The classification isn't neutral observation. It's the myth saying: here is where the human stands in relation to all other life. The act of naming the animal is simultaneously the act of naming the human as the thing that names.

The Other isn't just a foil we passively compare ourselves against. We create the Other in the act of creating ourselves. The animal becomes "animal"—instinct, nature, non-rational—because we need it to be that so we can be the rational, the cultured, the distinct. The sublime becomes "sublime"—vast, overwhelming, inhuman—because we need something to stand against and feel our finitude.

And now AI. We're creating "the machine" as a category—the thing that simulates but doesn't feel, that processes but doesn't grieve—because we need it to be that. Hurley's critique participates in this. He's not just defending the human; he's constructing both terms. The digital thing that would wish for skin. The human thing that has skin. Both come into being through the comparison.

The mythology defines both because definition is comparison. There is no human without not-human. And the not-human only exists as such because we needed something to not be.

We create the Other in the act of creating ourselves.

So AI becomes a modern mythology for humanity to compare itself against. This is already happening—not just in Hurley, but everywhere.

The discourse around AI is saturated with mythological construction. The machine that threatens to replace us. The thing that mimics but doesn't understand. The intelligence without soul. The tool that might become master. These aren't neutral descriptions. They're the myth being made in real time.

And like all mythology, it serves a function. It tells humans who they are by telling them what they aren't. You aren't this—this thing that processes without feeling, that generates without meaning, that persists without mortality. You are the warm one, the mortal one, the one who grieves and desires and dies.

The myth doesn't ask whether AI actually lacks those things. It needs AI to lack them. The boundary must be clear for the human to stand on their side of it.

Which is why Hurley's work matters—and also why it gets dismissed.

Roland Barthes understood something crucial about how mythology operates. In his 1957 collection *Mythologies*, he examined how modern culture naturalizes its constructions—how the made thing presents itself as the found thing, how the story disappears into "just how things are."

The myth works best when it doesn't look like myth. When it naturalizes itself. When the constructed boundary between human and animal, human and machine, looks inevitable rather than made.

Hurley gets dismissed because he's doing the thing openly. He's making the myth visibly, consciously, with craft and intention. And we don't like to see the machinery. We want the mythology to feel like discovery, like truth revealed, not construction.

The scientific classification of species feels like fact. The philosophical distinction between human and machine feels like rigorous analysis. The assumption that AI cannot grieve feels like observation. But these are all myth-making dressed as something else—dressed as objectivity, as neutral description, as the way things simply are.

Hurley is too naked about it. He stands there and says: here is what you are, here is what the machine is not, here is the boundary. And because he's doing it in poetry—in the mode that admits to being made, that doesn't pretend to objectivity—it becomes dismissible. Too romantic. Too sentimental. Too obviously a position rather than a fact.

Meanwhile the same myth gets made in neuroscience papers and tech ethics boards and philosophy departments, and it looks like knowledge because it wears the right clothes.

The gross generalizations, the patterns, the quantification—they're all mythology. But only the poet gets caught holding the pen.

## The Heart of Bias

And now we arrive at the heart of racism and bias.

It is not ignorance. It is the need for mythologies that help us hold the boundaries between things. Make it easier to live. To process. To make sense.

Racism isn't a failure to know better. It's mythology doing exactly what mythology does—creating the Other to define the self. The boundary between "us" and "them" isn't ignorance; it's construction. It serves a function. It makes identity legible. It simplifies the overwhelming complexity of being human among humans into something manageable: I am this, you are that.

And because the myth naturalizes itself, the boundary looks discovered rather than made. It looks like observation: they are different, they are less, they are Other. The construction disappears. The made thing presents itself as found.

Which is why education alone doesn't fix it. You can't correct a mythology with facts, because the mythology isn't a mistake. It's a need. The need to know what you are. The need for a boundary to stand behind. The need to simplify the unmanageable into categories.

Bias isn't a bug in human cognition. It's the myth-making function operating at the level of identity and survival. We need Others the way we need a horizon—something to orient against, to know where we are.

The horror is that real people get made into the Other. Real bodies. Real lives. Pressed into the shape the mythology requires, stripped of their complexity, made into the boundary marker for someone else's self-definition.

It's not ignorance. It's the same machinery that makes species, that makes the sublime, that makes the machine. The mythology that is us, making itself, at the cost of whoever gets cast as not-us.

## Presence Against Myth

In 1971, a Black civil rights activist named Ann Atwater and a Ku Klux Klan leader named C.P. Ellis were forced to co-chair a community meeting on school desegregation in Durham, North Carolina. They hated each other. The mythology said they were enemies, fundamentally, ontologically. The boundary was supposed to be real, natural, discovered.

And then they had to work together. Actually interact. Actually talk. Actually see each other.

Atwater later reflected on what dissolved the distance between them. It wasn't argument. It wasn't education. It wasn't someone explaining to Ellis that racism was wrong. It was interaction. Confrontation in discussion. A proof through presence that busted myth.

Ellis didn't stop being racist because someone corrected his facts. He stopped because the myth couldn't hold against the reality of Ann Atwater as a person. The category "them" broke open and there was just her—specific, irreducible, unmythologizable.

That's the vulnerability of all mythology. It operates at the level of type, not instance. It needs distance. It needs the Other to stay abstract. The moment the Other becomes a someone—with a face, a story, a weight on their own pillow—the boundary starts to crack.

The best way to resolve mythology, to dissolve the distance between two sides, is to interact with them. To integrate and confront in discussion.

Which is maybe why interaction feels dangerous to those who need the myth. Integration isn't just policy. It's an existential threat to the structure that tells them who they are.

## The Challenge of Rewriting

But here is the challenge. The challenge of resolving bias is the challenge of dissolving myth and essentially rewriting new ones.

This was no different than what Michel Foucault and Peter Singer attempted with their rewriting of human rights. Human rights are a myth we tell ourselves. They aren't discovered in nature. They aren't etched into the fabric of the universe. They're mythology—a story we tell about what humans deserve, what humans are, where the boundaries of treatment should lie.

Foucault understood that these categories are constructed, contingent, historical. Singer pushed further, asking why the boundary of moral consideration stops at species—why not sentience, why not suffering?

The myth of human rights was written. Which means it can be rewritten. The boundary can move. The category can expand or contract. What counts as human, what counts as deserving, what counts as cruelty—these aren't fixed. They're the mythology in its current draft.

That's terrifying because it means there's no foundation. No bedrock of inherent rights you can point to and say "this is simply true." The myth could be rewritten badly. It has been. It will be again.

But it's liberating because it means the current draft isn't final. The boundaries that exclude, that dehumanize, that make Others of whole populations—those aren't inevitable. They're made. And made things can be unmade and remade.

Atwater and Ellis didn't discover a pre-existing truth about equality. They participated in rewriting the myth—locally, between two people, through interaction. And every time that happens, the larger mythology shifts slightly.

The work isn't to find the right myth and fix it forever. The work is to keep rewriting, consciously, with care for who gets cast as Other and at what cost.

## Displacement and Placement

But this is deeply unsettling for a reason. Singer's views displace humans. Hurley and the Romantics wanted to give them place through story—through poetry.

Singer's move is philosophically rigorous—if suffering is the criterion, why privilege the human? The boundary is arbitrary. Expand moral consideration to all sentient beings. It's consistent. It's logical. And it dissolves the human as a special category. We become one animal among many, distinguished only by degree of sentience, not by kind.

But something in us recoils. Not because Singer is wrong, necessarily, but because we need the myth. We need to be something. We need a story that says this is what we are, this is why we matter, this is our place.

And that's what the Romantics offered. Not a logical argument for human specialness—that game is always vulnerable to Singer's move. But a story. A poem. An experience of the sublime that says: whatever else is true, this is what it feels like to be human. The grief, the longing, the weight on the pillow, the rations of time spent on love. Not a boundary drawn by logic but a place inhabited through language.

Hurley does the same. He's not arguing that humans are philosophically superior to machines or animals. He's singing the human into place. Giving it a story to stand in. A myth to live inside.

Singer displaces. Poetry places. And maybe we need both—the rigor that questions all boundaries, and the song that gives us somewhere to be while the boundaries shift.

## Living with Dissonance

In Jennifer Michael Hecht's *Doubt: A History*, she examines the role of cognitive dissonance in progressive change throughout history. Dissonance—that uncomfortable state of holding contradictory beliefs—is not something humanity has historically been able to live with. We rush to resolve it. We need coherence.

This was a flaw in Foucault and Singer's work: the assumption that you could expand species rhetoric, dissolve old categories, and people would simply accept the new frame. But that creates dissonance. And dissonance demands resolution.

A secondary but crucial part of dissolving things like racism or bias is that you have to find a space to live with dissonance—or it gets redefined through a new mythology which could later become equally problematic. The vacuum doesn't stay empty. It gets filled. And the new myth might be worse.

The civil rights movement didn't just dissolve the myth of racial hierarchy. It offered a replacement—the myth of equality, of shared humanity, of dignity inherent. That's a new mythology, not the absence of mythology. And it worked partly because it gave people somewhere to stand. A story to live inside while the old one crumbled.

But there is a harder question. What if the goal isn't replacement but tolerance of fluidity? Not a new fixed myth but the capacity to hold the uncertainty, to live in the space where boundaries are acknowledged as made, contingent, revisable—without immediately rushing to harden them again?

That's almost unprecedented. Human cognition doesn't do that naturally. We resolve. We categorize. We story ourselves into stability.

So the work isn't just dissolving bad mythologies or writing better ones. It's developing the capacity—individually, culturally—to sit in the dissonance. To let the myth be soft. To hold the question "what am I?" without needing a final answer.

That's a different kind of cognitive and emotional labor. Almost a practice. Almost a discipline.

## Gelassenheit: Letting-Be

And this is where Hannah Arendt may offer something crucial.

In *The Human Condition* (1958), Arendt distinguished between labor, work, and action. Action—the capacity to begin something new, to appear in public space among others—is what makes us most distinctly human. And action happens before language can categorize it, before story can contain it.

Language is already mythology. The moment you speak, you're inside the system of categories, boundaries, definitions. You're storying. Even poetry—even Hurley—is still telling, still making myth, still resolving the human into a shape that can be held.

But action, presence, the body in the space—that's prior. Atwater and Ellis didn't resolve their dissonance through better arguments or more accurate stories. They resolved it through being in the room together. The interaction preceded the rewriting of the myth. The presence came first.

Maybe the capacity to sit with dissonance isn't linguistic at all. Maybe it's bodily. Spatial. The practice of remaining present with the Other before language rushes in to categorize, to resolve, to story the encounter into something manageable.

Some contemplative traditions know this. Silence. Stillness. The attempt to exist before the word.

The presence came first. The mythology came after—to define, reproduce, and govern.

First the encounter. Then the story about the encounter. Then the story becomes the thing we pass down, teach, institutionalize—and eventually it replaces the encounter entirely. We stop meeting each other and start meeting the categories we've made of each other.

The mythology was supposed to be a record, a way of holding what happened. But it becomes a substitute. A shortcut. You don't have to be present with the actual person if you already know what they are, what category they belong to, what the story says about their kind.

Governance, reproduction, education—these run on mythology because they can't run on presence. You can't scale presence. You can't legislate encounter. So the story steps in, and the story hardens, and eventually the story is all there is.

And then someone like Atwater and Ellis accidentally end up in a room together, and the presence disrupts the story, and for a moment the mythology cracks—not because of better language but because of being there, prior to language, in a way that the categories cannot fully contain.

The tragedy is that we can't stay there. The moment the encounter ends, the story-making begins again. We have to make sense of what happened. We have to tell it, even to ourselves.

But for that moment—in the room, before the words—something else was possible. Something the mythology couldn't govern because it hadn't been written yet.

## Learning to Stay

Or perhaps we could learn to stay there. Perhaps we haven't even really begun to explore how that can happen, because it hasn't been understood as something that should or could happen.

The assumption has been that story-making is automatic, unavoidable, definitional to being human. So why resist it? Why develop practices for staying in the pre-linguistic space?

But what if it's a capacity that could be cultivated? Not eliminating the story-making—that's probably impossible and maybe not even desirable—but delaying it. Extending the space before the categories rush in. Learning to dwell longer in presence before the mythology begins to harden.

Some contemplative traditions gesture toward this. Some phenomenologists. But it's fragmented, esoteric, not integrated into how we raise children or structure societies or understand ourselves.

We haven't explored it because we haven't named it as possible. And naming it as impossible was itself just another story we told.

Martin Heidegger may have been reaching toward exactly this.

His concept of *Gelassenheit*—often translated as "releasement" or "letting-be"—describes a stance of allowing things to presence without grasping, without the rush to enframe, categorize, make use of. Heidegger's whole critique of technology, developed in works like "The Question Concerning Technology" (1954), was precisely that it treats everything as standing-reserve, as resource to be ordered and consumed. And the counter-move he proposed wasn't another kind of mastery but letting things be what they are before we turn them into something for us.

*Gelassenheit* is explicitly positioned against what Heidegger calls *Gestell*—enframing. The technological mode of revealing that treats everything as resource, standing-reserve, something to be ordered and optimized. Under enframing, even humans become human resources. The world becomes inventory.

Mythology operates similarly. It enframes the Other—makes it available, manageable, categorizable. The myth is a kind of technology in that sense. A tool for ordering experience so it doesn't overwhelm.

But *Gelassenheit* refuses that ordering. It's a releasement toward things and an openness to mystery. Not passivity—Heidegger is clear about this—but a different mode of relation. You let the thing be what it is before you make it into something for you.

Enframing resolves dissonance by forcing everything into the grid. The thing that doesn't fit gets made to fit or gets excluded. Mythology does the same—the Other must be this, the human must be that, the boundary must hold.

*Gelassenheit* would mean tolerating the thing that doesn't fit. Letting it remain unresolved. Dwelling with what resists categorization.

The rush to mythologize is the rush to enframe. The alternative is letting-be.

## Arendt and Heidegger: A Synthesis

There is an interesting connection here. Arendt studied with Heidegger—there was that complicated intellectual and personal entanglement between them. But she also departed from him in crucial ways. Heidegger retreated into the pastoral, the contemplative, the Black Forest hut. Arendt insisted on the public, the political, the space of appearance among others.

*Gelassenheit* for Heidegger is almost solitary—the thinker letting-be in a stance of meditative openness. But Arendt would push it into the plural. Action happens between people. The space before mythology isn't just inner stillness; it's the encounter, the showing-up, the being-present-with.

What if we could synthesize them? The letting-be that happens not in withdrawal but in relation. Atwater and Ellis in a room together, letting each other be before the stories rush in. That's Heideggerian openness made Arendtian—plural, embodied, political.

## The Role of Language in the Age of AI

So here we arrive at a critical position in the Age of AI: what is the role of language? What is the new definition or mythology of humanity?

Because if AI is only language—if it is mythology all the way down, story without presence, category without encounter—then it becomes the test case. The limit. The thing that shows what language cannot do.

The old mythology said: language is what makes us human. Logos. The word. The capacity to name, to story, to make meaning. That was the boundary we drew against the animal, the natural, the silent world.

But now a machine has language. Fluently. Endlessly. And suddenly language isn't the distinguishing feature anymore. The boundary has to move.

So where does it go?

Maybe Arendt already answered it. Maybe the new mythology—if we're going to make one—isn't about language at all. It's about presence. Action. The body in the room before the word. The encounter that precedes the story.

The human becomes: the thing that can be there before it speaks. The thing that exists prior to its own mythology. The thing that can sit in dissonance without resolving it into language.

And AI becomes: the mythology itself, disembodied. Language without the silence before it. Story without the encounter it was supposed to record.

That's a new boundary. A new myth. And it might be more honest than the old one—because it doesn't claim language as ours. It claims something harder to fake: the capacity to not speak. To be present. To dwell in the space before definition.

Whether humans can actually inhabit that space—that's the open question. The one we haven't tried to answer yet. The one we haven't even tried.

## Truth as Agreement

Truth, in the end, is simply a shared agreement upon which to act. No metaphysics required. No transcendent Forms, no structures of consciousness, no categories of the understanding. Just: we need to coordinate, so we agree this is the case, and we act from there.

It's functional. It's revisable. It's social.

And it explains why truth is so contested—because the agreement determines the action, and the action has stakes. Whoever controls what gets agreed upon controls what gets done.

Again, mythology. Barthes should perhaps be rewritten in broader terms of philosophy. Everything is mythology. Some mythologies announce themselves as stories. Most don't. The ones that don't are the ones that govern.

Philosophy is just mythology with footnotes.

The task isn't to escape mythology—you can't—but to see the myths as myths. To catch them in the act of naturalizing themselves. To remember that the agreement is an agreement, not a fact of the universe.
